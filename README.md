## üöÄ Features

- **Physics-based movement** using Rigidbody
- **WASD controls** for intuitive player movement
- **Easy integration** into any Unity project
- **Customizable force** for speed adjustment
- **Clean, well-documented C# code**
- **Open source** and free to use

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/emotional-push/Movement-Script.git
   ```
2. **Add `movment.cs` to your Unity project** (found in the `Script/` folder).
3. **Attach the script** to your player GameObject.
4. **Ensure a Rigidbody** component is attached to the GameObject (not kinematic).

---

## üéÆ Usage

- Use **WASD** keys to move the object.
- Adjust the `moveForce` parameter in the Inspector for desired speed.
- Make sure your GameObject has a Rigidbody (not kinematic).

## üìÑ Example Script

```csharp
// Script/movment.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class PlayerMovement : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float moveForce = 10f;
    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
        if (rb == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("No Rigidbody attached to " + gameObject.name + ". PlayerMovement requires a Rigidbody component.");
        }
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        Vector3 force = Vector3.zero;

        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W))
            force += transform.forward;
        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S))
            force -= transform.forward;
        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A))
            force -= transform.right;
        if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D))
            force += transform.right;

        if (force != Vector3.zero && rb != null)
            rb.AddForce(force.normalized * moveForce);
    }
}
```
